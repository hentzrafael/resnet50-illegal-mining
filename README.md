![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python project that leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the ResNet50 architecture to detect illegal mining sites in satellite images. The project uses the WorldStrat dataset, which includes satellite images of various forest regions.

Illegal mining poses a significant threat to our environment, contributing to deforestation, pollution, and the degradation of biodiversity. This project aims to address this issue through cutting-edge technology and deep learning.

## Key Features

- Utilizes ResNet50 CNN architecture for image classification.
- Trains the model on the WorldStrat dataset, specifically curated for this purpose.
- Detects illegal mining sites in satellite images with high accuracy.
- Contributes to environmental conservation and the protection of our natural resources.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `presentations/`: Contains files related to the project presentation.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file.
